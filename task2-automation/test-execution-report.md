## 🐛 Failed Tests Analysis

### 1. Authentication Flow - Invalid Credentials Test (WebKit)
- **Test**: `should show error for invalid credentials`
- **Browser**: WebKit
- **Error**: Timeout waiting for error message or URL change
- **Root Cause**: WebKit handles form submission differently, may need browser-specific handling
- **Recommendation**: Add WebKit-specific assertions or increase timeout

### 2. Single Transaction - Save Transaction (WebKit)
- **Test**: `should save transaction successfully with valid data`
- **Browser**: WebKit  
- **Error**: Form submission not completing within timeout
- **Root Cause**: Possible WebKit-specific timing issue with form processing
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit wait conditions for WebKit

### 3. Split Transaction - Issue 1 Regression Test (All Browsers)
- **Test**: `should test Issue 1: Uneven Split Transaction Distribution`
- **Browser**: All (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Error**: Expected behavior vs actual behavior mismatch
- **Root Cause**: **This is the expected failure** - the test confirms the bug exists
- **Status**: ✅ **Working as intended** - validates Issue 1 from exploratory testing

## ⚠️ Skipped Tests

### 1. Date Field Validation - Issue 4 Regression Test
- **Reason**: Date input field not found on current page structure
- **Impact**: Cannot validate future date acceptance bug
- **Recommendation**: Update selectors or investigate page structure changes
